Automate Extend To Customer and/or Vendor via Import Scenario 
==================================
An Extension that allows to automate Extend To Customer/Vendor during Import.

Out-of-box Extend To Vendor or Extend To Customer actions cannot be used in Import Scenario since it redirects to vendor and customer screen respectively with pre-populated data and user has to manually save the vendor.

In this customization, we are creating a new hidden actions which invokes base action and persists the data rather redirecting to screen.
